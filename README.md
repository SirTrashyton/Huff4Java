# What is Huffman?
Huffman is loseless compression and decompression for non-compressed files.
It works by placing data from a file into a BST, where the most used characters are placed higher on the tree.
Because most files are already compress, this algorithm will only shorten "raw" files. All files can be converted to .huff's but most formats are already compressed.
Structure of '.huff' files are in the following order:
Number of bytes, Tree data, Traversal Data

# What I Learned
Basic data structures and file reading.
Binary search trees, leaf/node and recursive operations.
Cross-platform UI development using JavaFX and SceneBuilder.
